# CartPole-Visualizer
 A simple reinforcement learning environment that trains a cart to balance a pole upright. Built with Gymnasium, Box2D and Stable-Baselines3.

 * 4D state space — position, velocity, pole angle, and angular velocity
 * Discrete actions — move left or right with a fixed force
 * Reward system — +1 per step alive, 0 if the pole falls or cart goes out of bounds
